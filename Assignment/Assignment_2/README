This is the code for Realtime thread scheduling and analysis of how the treads are scheduled and how priorities are handled 
To generate the output file, run the following command:
sh run.sh
it will generate an output file called 
Main.out

The program takes in parameters as shown below
 ./Main.out <name of input file> <'Y' if priority inheritance needed,anything else if not>

eg:
 ./Main.out input_1.txt Y  # this will read file input_1.txt and will apply priority inheritance
  
Note:
run it superuser mode or change /dev/input/mice file permissions to 666

./test/ folder has the test file used by me for checking priorit inversion,priority inheritance and task overrun 
it has trace.dat of exectution without priority inheritance.
